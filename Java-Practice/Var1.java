/*Just to give a reminder that there are three types of variables: static , local, instance
 * but here we used only static variables
 * And also there are 8 Primitive types variables and some reference type variables too
 * Remember - don't use '0' while using char ascii codes as it will represent the octal value to the compiler and won't return the expected decimal value in ascii code
